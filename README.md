This project focuses on predicting the prices of used Audi cars from the dataset found here: https://www.kaggle.com/mysarahmadbhat/audi-used-car-listings
As a model for price prediction I use Sklearn's Linear Regression.
At first I perform an exploratory analysis to get the gist of the data. After that, I build the first model using all the available features. As a next step, I try to optimize the performance of the model.
